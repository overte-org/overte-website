From the beginning Overte VR software was planned to be supported by the Overte e.V nonprofit association. 
Finally this association has been founded by the founding members. 

It is a nonprofit association and has the sole purpose of promoting and distributing free Social VR software on terms of free software, and the program package “Overte” in particular, to promote the free exchange of knowledge and equality of opportunity in accessing software as well as education, science and research.

The first board has also been elected. Here are the board members:
- Dale
- Moto
- Catraxx   
- 74hc595   
- Kreolis   
- Micah
